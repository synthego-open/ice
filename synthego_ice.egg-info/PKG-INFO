Description: 
        ICE tool is a CRISPR editing analysis tool that infers presence of indels and other mutation. ICE uses non-negative least squares regression to detect the presence or evidence of edits. In contrast to TIDE1, ICE can analyze insertions, deletions, HDR, multiplex edits, and base editing and is available open source for non-commercial use (See LICENSE FOR DETAILS). ICE can also be used for analysis of other genome engineering methods, such as TALEN and homing endonucleases.
